# ðŸ˜„ Welcome to IMDb Analyzer

First of all, thank you for visiting this website. This dashboard was designed and developed for all the movie lovers and IMDb users around the world.

IMDb Analyzer is a single page application in which users can explore and analyze their own "Movie Viewing History" data based on their IMDb user rating activities. This dashboard lets users discover their movie preferences and tendencies on movies.

Although IMDb official website provides basic visualization features, it's not sufficient enough to fully explore and know your movie rating activities. We encourage users to use this dashboard as a way to complement those features.

To setup your data and start exploring viewing history, see the upload procedure for more information. Enjoy!
